\chapter{Photons Short}

\paragraph{
A short introduction of the model without details or applications.}

\paragraph{}
A long time ago I was trying to to make a model of a photon, that somehow would be more easy to imagine and visualize,  and which would allow for the possibility to interact with other particles in a more defined manner. This had to be reached by being more explicit about the photon.

Much advance in physics has been made by assuming and discovering a smaller level and every time one goes from one level to a smaller one, more things can be explained in better details. The atoms which make up the molecules. The electrons and protons, which give rise to a charged particle, if there is a surplus of one kind. In general one can state that even a neutral particle can have charges as long as they are equal.


In the following piece I want to introduce a model of a photon that

A photon must generate a field according to Maxwell, which has two components, an electrical and a magnetic field, which are both perpendicular to each other and are perpendicular to the direction in which the photon moves. Both the electrical and the magnetic field oscillate in a sinusoidal manner.
A photon can be replaced by two massless point charges, which have opposite charge and rotate around the central imaginary point in the middle. The central point in the middle goes forward with the speed of light c, and the massless point charges rotate around this moving central point with a frequency that corresponds with their wavelength c.q. energy.
So it is an electrical dipole rotating around the central point, which moves with c.
The question is what will a stationary, non rotating, observer see from these rotating dipoles. As the speed of the photon is c, one of the massless point charges (to be called ornac hereafter) will be moving with a speed above c and the other one with a speed under c.
Here we need to expand electromagnetism to include massless charges moving above the speed of light c. A global inspection of the Maxwell equations (with one half closed eye) makes one guess that the speed of light is the limit, the absolute horizon for interaction between two particles. 

First we take a look at the electric field. Let us assume that the part of the electric field, which is moving with a speed above c, has to be ignored.
In the case of the rotating dipole one charged particle will be moving above c and thus be invisible and the other one will be moving under c and be visible. The border between visible and invisible part of the electric field lays exactly in the middle at the central point which moves with c.
We now need to further define the movement of the massless dipole. If you follow the movement of a bicycle wheel over a road and you concentrate on one point fixed to the rim for example the valve, you will notice that the valve moves with twice the speed of the bike when it is at the top of the wheel and that its speed is zero when it touches the ground (otherwise the wheel would slip). This bike wheel movement is beneficial to our model of the photon, which we want to build, because it lets one of the massless charges, stop its motion with regard to the non moving world. This short stop in motion allows for time to interact with particles that do not move. And this short stop in motion coincides with maximum field strength.
The image below shows the idea.

One  can ask why do those two particles stay together? Why do they stay connected? But it is better to move into the perspective of the photon and position one self a top of one of the massless charged particles. If you look to the center, you see at the other side another particle, which is stationary, while the rest of the world is moving with variable speeds some parts move above c and hence are invisible. So the solid rock in your existence is that massless particle at the other side. While between the center and your self is an area and stage, where some times appear other charged particles, they move to the center line, slow down, stop for an unendless short time, accelerate and move of the stage. That is the big picture.

So we have a photon, which consists of two charged massless particles, who both rotate around a moving center. And there is a certain area, let's call it the sub-c stage, where interaction with slower moving particles is possible.

and that the electromagnetic fields of particles moving above this speed will not be sensed by other particles.
