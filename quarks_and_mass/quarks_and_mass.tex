\chapter{Quarks and mass}

The next question is whether the same system can be used for building matter? Ordinary matter consisting of quarks, which themselves are then made up of charged sub-particles rotating partially above the speed of light? The same way we have build up photons out of charged sub-particles, which rotate partially above $c$.    It is certainly possible. 

Quarks are light particles, which for example give charge to protons and neutrons and are strongly bound by a force, conveniently called the strong force. The quarks themselves are light only representing about 1\% of the mass of nucleons. The mass of protons and neutrons results from the strong bond between them, which stores 99\% of the energy and mass of the nuclea.

Let's assume that the quark can be build up of one non moving charge, that is fixed in the middle and one opposed charge, which is circling the stationary one. If the circling charge is moving with a speed above c, that charge and the party of the magnetic field above $c$, will be invisible to the rest of the world, which is not rotating around the same axis.

We have to inspect in more detail, the way in which the hyper-c magnetic field works for rotating charges. First let's take a look at a simple situation: we want to know what happens to a test charge or observer, which is not on the axis of rotation of the charged particle pair. Figure shows the idea. Because the observer is off axis, it only sees the non rotating charge in the middle and only that part of the magnetic field, which is under the speed of light c. The second case: we have two charged particle pairs and these pairs both rotate around the same axis, in the same direction and with the same angular speed. Of each pair the rotating charge generates a magnetic field, because they both are perfectly aligned and have the same angular speed, their magnetic fields couple full, as well the part under c as the part above c. If we add an observer, who is located off axis, he will see: both non rotating charges and their magnetic fields under c , but he will be amazed by the large force between them, because the hyper-c magnetic field is beyond his horizon of perception. The third case: the same particle pairs as before, on the same axis, but now one rotating in the other direction. As the rotation is opposing they only see each others normal magnetic field and not the hyper-c field. So while being on the same axis is satisfied, it is also crucial to rotate in the same direction. The fourth case: two particle pairs rotating around the same axis, in the same angular direction, but with a different angular speed.  They both see each others normal magnetic field. The hyper-c magnetic field is more complicated. It is clear that they see each others hyper-c field partially, but not completely as their angular speeds do not match perfectly. Let us assume that coupling between the particle pairs is mutually equal. So if one of the pairs sees 70\% of the others field, it is visa versa.
As we have now clarified the basics of the coupling and limitations of the hyper-c magnetic field, we can use this to build more or less stable matter. The massless charged rotating particle pairs can be connected together with a force, which is much stronger than the magnetic force alone, as long as we make sure that the particle pairs rotate along the same axis and in the same direction. For brevity we introduce the name "ornac pair" to designate the massless charged rotating particle pair, in which one of the charges rotates with a speed above c and hence allows for coupling to the hyper-c magnetic field. Looking to the quark model for matter shows that it makes most sense to assume a charge of +/- 1/3 electron for the charged massless particle and to use some times two of them.
