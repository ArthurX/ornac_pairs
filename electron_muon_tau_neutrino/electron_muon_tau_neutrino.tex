\chapter{Electron, muon, tau en neutrinos}

The electron, muon and tau and their neutrinos can be build up in a similar way to the proton and neutron. the electron is build up of 3 ornac pairs orientated along a common axis. because the magnetic moment of the electron is much larger, the ornac pair has to rotate with a much lower speed, so that a larger area is below the speed of light. as the angular speed of the electrons ornac pairs is lower than that of protons ornac pairs, those different pairs do not couple strongly. Also the hyper-c field of the electron ornac-pair is lower, so the force between the electron ornac-pairs themselves is also smaller. And so the weight, mass and energy contained within the electron is lower.

The muon and tau particles are heavier and their magnetic moments are smaller. So the angular speed of their ornac-pairs will be higher. They fit nicely between electron and proton ornac-pairs. The following table puts them next to each other.

If a meson decays and falls apart to form an electron, a neutrino and an amount of energy in the shape of photos, w know that there were two quarks, consisting of two ornac-pairs, together they decay and form the new groups of ornac-pairs: 3 for the electron and 3 for the neutrino. Besides that charge, energy and spin need to be conserved, also the total angular momentum for all the ornac-pairs needs to be conserved.
