\chapter{High energy physics}

High energy physics is the field of research, where particles are accelerated until speeds close to the speed of light $c$ and then collide. The first question is, how will the ornac-pair model of protons look like at those speeds. 

If particles are accelerated, their energy content increases. If the distance between the ornac-pairs is reduced, the forces increase and the total stored energy increases. All fits well with formula . So there could be a mechanism, where the energy can be stored. A question would be why the ornac-pairs can come closer together? Is there a reduced coupling to other mass around?

Now we can have a model like this: the high speed particles are closer together and contain more energy by being compressed, just like a spring and if they now collide with other particles, all this energy is contained in a small space, the higher, the energy, the more it is concentrated in a compact space.

It sounds not like a big deal, just like the photons: the higher their energy, the smaller their wavelength becomes.
